{"role":"user","content":"so the speec tool when enabled makes you always speak with voice too? not only when you need to?","timestamp":1769686269597}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Good question! Looking at my currently enabled tools, I can see that the speech tool (`speak`) is not currently enabled - I disabled it after you mentioned the background voice issue.\n\nThe `speak` tool is meant to be used selectively when you specifically want me to speak something aloud, not automatically for every response. It seems like there might have been some unexpected behavior where it was continuing to speak in the background even when I wasn't explicitly calling it. \n\nWhen I use the `speak` tool, it should only speak the specific text I send to it in that moment, not make me speak everything automatically. The fact that you were hearing background voice suggests there might have been a technical issue with how it was running.\n\nDoes the background voice seem to have stopped now that I've disabled the tool?","timestamp":1769686278546}
